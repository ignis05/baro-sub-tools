# Barotrauma Submarine Tools

Tools for submarine building in Barotrauma

Working fully-client sided in the browser.

Master branch hosted on https://ignis05.github.io/baro-sub-tools/index.html

# Currently available tools:

-  `change price` allows you to set your submarine's price to any value you want, without any limitations
-  `clean walls` will remove any bloodstains, paint or water stains from the background walls
-  `hide all wires` will mark all wires as "hiden in game"

## Run Script

-  write any script using `$submarine` variable with submarine data as jquery xml object and run it to modify your .sub file directly

## Extract preview image and drones

-  `extract preview image` button saves loaded submarine's preview image as .png file
-  dynamically generated buttons that pull linked submarines from the main submarine file and save them as independent .sub files.
